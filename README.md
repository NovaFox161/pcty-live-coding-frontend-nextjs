This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app) and styled with TailwindCSS.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/todo](http://localhost:3000/api/todo). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/todo.ts`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

## Tailwind CSS

Tailwind CSS is a styling framework for React projects. Its similar in nature to Bootstrap, but with many benefits such as only shipping the css classes being used.

- [Tailwind Cheatsheet](https://tailwindcomponents.com/cheatsheet/) - A great resource for quickly locating and understanding what Tailwind classes are available and their underlying CSS.
